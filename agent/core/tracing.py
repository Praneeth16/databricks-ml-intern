"""MLflow Tracing for agent observability.

Replaces the previous HF-dataset trajectory upload + custom Delta KPI tables
with native MLflow Tracing. Each user turn becomes one trace; tool calls and
LLM calls hang off it as child spans. The MLflow UI under the configured
experiment shows the full agent loop tree, and Lakeview dashboards roll the
spans up into cost / latency / tool-mix charts.

Usage::

    init_tracing(settings.experiment_path)              # once per session

    with trace_span("agent_turn", {"turn_index": 4}):    # span every turn
        ...

    @traced(name="tool.run")                             # span every tool call
    async def call_tool(...): ...

All helpers are fail-soft: if MLflow init can't reach the workspace (e.g.
during unit tests), trace_span yields None and traced returns the function
unwrapped. The agent never breaks because telemetry can't connect.
